1. Generate Input: Create the input JSON file to create our Merkle tree with:
   - the eligible addresses and
   - the corresponding amounts they can receive

2. The second script that we are going to create is for creating our Merkle tree using the input file generated by Generate Input and this will create
   - Create the hashes, the intermidiate hashes and the root hash 
   - Create an output file that contains all of the leaf hashes, the intermidiate hashes, the proofs for each leaf node, and the root hash 
  
These scripts are going to be called by the Merkle airdrop deployer

To do these scripts we are going to actually use murky "dmfxyz/murky"

forge install dmfxyz/murky@5feccd1253d7da820f7cccccdedf64471025455d --no-commit
